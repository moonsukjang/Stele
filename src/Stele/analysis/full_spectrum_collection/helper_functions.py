    This helper function takes a FullHighSideband.full_dict attribute and a

    full_dict.

    The first input doesn't change, so f there's a PMT set of data involved, it
    should be in the full variable to keep the laser normalization intact.

    The original function has been updated to take the full object (instead of
    the dicts alone) to better handle calculating ratios when stitching. This
    is called once things have been parsed in the original function (or legacy
    code where dicts are passed instead of the object)

    Inputs:
    full = full_dict from FullHighSideband, or HighSidebandPMT.  It's important
           that it contains lower orders than the new_dict.
    new_dict = another full_dict.
    need_ratio = If gain or other parameters aren't equal and must resort to
                 calculating the ratio instead of the measurements being
                 equivalent. Changing integration time still means N photons
                 made M counts, but changing gain or using PMT or whatever does
                 affect things.

    Returns:
    full = extended version of the input full.  Overlapping sidebands are
           averaged because that makes sense?

    11/14/16
    --------
    This function has been updated to take the CCD objects themselves to be
    more intelligent about stitching. Consider two scans, (a) spec step 0 with
    1 gain, spec step 2 with 110 gain and (b) spec step 0 with 50 gain and spec
    step 1 with 110 gain. The old version would always take spec step 0 to
    scale to, so while comparisons between spec step 0 and 1 for either case is
    valid, comparison between (a) and (b) were not, since they were scaled to
    different gain parameters. This new code will check what the gain values
    are and scale to the 110 data set, if present. This seems valid because we
    currently always have a 110 gain exposure for higher order sidebands. The
    exception is if the laser is present (sideband 0), as that is an absolute
    measure to which all else should be related.
    TODO: run some test cases to test this.

    06/11/18
    --------
    That sometimes was breaking if there were only 3-4 sidebands to fit with
    poor SNR. I've added the override_ratio to be passed to set a specific
    ratio to scale by. From data on 06/03/18, the 50gain to 110gain is a ~3.6
    ratio. I haven't done a clean way of specifying which data set it should be
    scaled. Right now, it leaves the laser line data, or the 110 gain data
    alone.


    Inputs:
    full = full_dict from FullHighSideband, or HighSidebandPMT.  It's important
           that it contains lower orders than the new_dict.

                 made M counts, but changing gain or using PMT or whatever does
                 affect things.
    ratios: Will update with the values to the ratios needed to scale the data.
            ratios[0] is the ratio for the "full_obj"
            ratios[1] is the ratio for the "new_obj"
            one of them will be one, one will be the appropriate scale, since
            one of them is unscaled. This is strictly speaking an output
    override_ratio: Pass a float to specify the ratio that should be used.
    ignore_weaker_lowers: Sometimes, a SB is in the short pass filter so a
        lower order is weaker than the next highest. If True, causes script to
        ignore all sidebands which are weaker and lower order.
    spn: One integer that identifies a sideband caught in the short pass filter
    of the CCD.
